 1. Integer Expression Calculation
 Using the AddTwo program from Section 3.2 as a reference, write a program that calculates the
 following expression, using registers: A = (A + B) âˆ’ (C + D). Assign integer values to the EAX,
 EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.
 2. Symbolic Integer Constants
 Write a program that defines symbolic constants for all seven days of the week. Create an array
 variable that uses the symbols as initializers.
 3. Data Definitions
 Write a program that contains a definition of each data type listed in Table 3-2 in Section 3.4.
 Initialize each variable to a value that is consistent with its data type.
 4. Symbolic Text Constants
 Write a program that defines symbolic names for several string literals (characters between
 quotes). Use each symbolic name in a variable definition.
 5. Listing File for AddTwoSum
 Generate a listing file for the AddTwoSum program and write a description of the machine code
 bytes generated for each instruction. You might have to guess at some of the meanings of the
 byte values.
 6. AddVariables Program
 Modify the AddVariables program so it uses 64-bit variables. Describe the syntax errors gener
ated by the assembler and what steps you took to resolve the errors.
