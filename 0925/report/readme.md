3. How do you reserve space for the stack in a program?
4. Explain why the term assembler language is not quite correct.
5. Explain the difference between big endian and little endian. Also, look up the origins of this
term on the Web.
6. Why might you use a symbolic constant rather than an integer literal in your code?
7. How is a source file different from a listing file?
8. How are data labels and code labels different?
9. (True/False): An identifier cannot begin with a numeric digit.
10. (True/False): A hexadecimal literal may be written as 0x3A.
11. (True/False): Assembly language directives execute at runtime.
12. (True/False): Assembly language directives can be written in any combination of uppercase
and lowercase letters.
13. Name the four basic parts of an assembly language instruction.
14. (True/False): MOV is an example of an instruction mnemonic.
15. (True/False): A code label is followed by a colon (:), but a data label does not end with a
colon.
16. Show an example of a block comment.
17. Why is it not a good idea to use numeric addresses when writing instructions that access
variables?
18. What type of argument must be passed to the ExitProcess procedure?

23. (True/False): A Listing file is produced by the Assembler.
24. (True/False): A link library is added to a program just before producing an Executable file.
25. Which data directive creates a 32-bit signed integer variable?
26. Which data directive creates a 16-bit signed integer variable?
27. Which data directive creates a 64-bit unsigned integer variable?
28. Which data directive creates an 8-bit signed integer variable?
29. Which data directive creates a 10-byte packed BCD variable?

1. Define four symbolic constants that represent integer 25 in decimal, binary, octal,
and hexadecimal formats.
2. Find out, by trial and error, if a program can have multiple code and data segments.
3. Create a data definition for a doubleword that stored it in memory in big endian
format.
4. Find out if you can declare a variable of type DWORD and assign it a negative
value. What does this tell you about the assembler’s type checking?
5. Write a program that contains two instructions: (1) add the number 5 to the EAX
register, and (2) add 5 to the EDX register. Generate a listing file and examine the
machine code generated by the assembler. What differences, if any, did you find
between the two instructions?
6. Given the number 456789ABh, list out its byte values in little-endian order.
7. Declare an array of 120 uninitialized unsigned doubleword values.
8. Declare an array of byte and initialize it to the first 5 letters of the alphabet.
9. Declare a 32-bit signed integer variable and initialize it with the smallest possible
negative decimal value. (Hint: Refer to integer ranges in Chapter 1.)
10. Declare an unsigned 16-bit integer variable named wArray that uses three initializers.
11. Declare a string variable containing the name of your favorite color. Initialize it as
a nullterminated string.
12. Declare an uninitialized array of 50 signed doublewords named dArray.
13. Declare a string variable containing the word “TEST” repeated 500 times.
14. Declare an array of 20 unsigned bytes named bArray and initialize all elements to
zero.

15. Show the order of individual bytes in memory (lowest to highest) for the following doubleword variable:
val1 DWORD 87654321h

1. Integer Expression Calculation
Using the AddTwo program from Section 3.2 as a reference, write a program that calculates the
following expression, using registers: A = (A + B) − (C + D). Assign integer values to the EAX,
EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.
2. Symbolic Integer Constants
Write a program that defines symbolic constants for all seven days of the week. Create an array
variable that uses the symbols as initializers.
3. Data Definitions
Write a program that contains a definition of each data type listed in Table 3-2 in Section 3.4.
Initialize each variable to a value that is consistent with its data type.
4. Symbolic Text Constants
Write a program that defines symbolic names for several string literals (characters between
quotes). Use each symbolic name in a variable definition.
5. Listing File for AddTwoSum
Generate a listing file for the AddTwoSum program and write a description of the machine code
bytes generated for each instruction. You might have to guess at some of the meanings of the
byte values.
6. AddVariables Program
Modify the AddVariables program so it uses 64-bit variables. Describe the syntax errors generated by the assembler and what steps you took to resolve the errors.
