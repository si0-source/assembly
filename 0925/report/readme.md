1. Provide examples of three different instruction mnemonics.**MOV,ADD,SUB**
2. What is a calling convention, and how is it used in assembly language declarations?**누가 옮기고 누가받는 지를 정하는 정하는 거, INVOKE도 그 사용처 중 하나**
3. How do you reserve space for the stack in a program?**.stack을 사용**
4. Explain why the term assembler language is not quite correct.**어셈블러는 어셈블리어를 두루는 프로그램이다 언어가 아니다**
5. Explain the difference between big endian and little endian. Also, look up the origins of this
term on the Web.**리틀은 연산 최하위 바이트부터 저장, 빅은 네트워크 최상부터 저장, 걸리버 여행기에 나온 계란을 위부터 깨먹냐 아래부터 깨냐의 논쟁에 나온 단어**
6. Why might you use a symbolic constant rather than an integer literal in your code?**적은 장비로 가성비 좋은 결과를 내서**
7. How is a source file different from a listing file?**소스코드는 사람이 읽고 쓰는거, 리스팅은 기계가 생성하는 거**

14. (True/False): MOV is an example of an instruction mnemonic.**True**
15. (True/False): A code label is followed by a colon (:), but a data label does not end with a
colon.**True**
16. Show an example of a block comment.**COMMENT  !
 This line is a comment.

22. (True/False): An Object file is produced by the Linker.
23. (True/False): A Listing file is produced by the Assembler.
24. (True/False): A link library is added to a program just before producing an Executable file.
