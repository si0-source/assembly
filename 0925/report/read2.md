1. Define four symbolic constants that represent integer 25 in decimal, binary, octal,
 and hexadecimal formats.
 2. Find out, by trial and error, if a program can have multiple code and data segments.
 3. Create a data definition for a doubleword that stored it in memory in big endian
 format.
 4. Find out if you can declare a variable of type DWORD and assign it a negative
 value. What does this tell you about the assembler’s type checking?
 5. Write a program that contains two instructions: (1) add the number 5 to the EAX
 register, and (2) add 5 to the EDX register. Generate a listing file and examine the
 machine code generated by the assembler. What differences, if any, did you find
 between the two instructions?
 6. Given the number 456789ABh, list out its byte values in little-endian order.
 7. Declare an array of 120 uninitialized unsigned doubleword values.
 8. Declare an array of byte and initialize it to the first 5 letters of the alphabet.
 9. Declare a 32-bit signed integer variable and initialize it with the smallest possible
 negative decimal value. (Hint: Refer to integer ranges in Chapter 1.)
 10. Declare an unsigned 16-bit integer variable named wArray that uses three initial
izers.
 11. Declare a string variable containing the name of your favorite color. Initialize it as
 a nullterminated string.
 12. Declare an uninitialized array of 50 signed doublewords named dArray.
 13. Declare a string variable containing the word “TEST” repeated 500 times.
 14. Declare an array of 20 unsigned bytes named bArray and initialize all elements to
 zero.
