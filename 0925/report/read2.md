1. Define four symbolic constants that represent integer 25 in decimal, binary, octal,
 and hexadecimal formats.**25,11001,31,19**
 2. Find out, by trial and error, if a program can have multiple code and data segments.**가능**
 3. Create a data definition for a doubleword that stored it in memory in big endian
 format.**최상위부터 바이트단위로 저장**
 4. Find out if you can declare a variable of type DWORD and assign it a negative
 value. What does this tell you about the assembler’s type checking?**가능**
 5. Write a program that contains two instructions: (1) add the number 5 to the EAX
 register, and (2) add 5 to the EDX register. Generate a listing file and examine the
 machine code generated by the assembler. What differences, if any, did you find
 between the two instructions?**add eax, 5<br>
 add edx, 5<br>
 eax쪽이 더 코드가 짧다**
 6. Given the number 456789ABh, list out its byte values in little-endian order.**AB896745**
 7. Declare an array of 120 uninitialized unsigned doubleword values.**a DWORD 120 DUP(?)**
 8. Declare an array of byte and initialize it to the first 5 letters of the alphabet.**abcde BYTE 'A','B','C','D','E'**
 9. Declare a 32-bit signed integer variable and initialize it with the smallest possible
 negative decimal value. (Hint: Refer to integer ranges in Chapter 1.)**min SDWORD -2147483648**
 10. Declare an unsigned 16-bit integer variable named wArray that uses three initial
izers.**wArray WORD 1000h, 2000h, 3000h**
 11. Declare a string variable containing the name of your favorite color. Initialize it as
 a nullterminated string.**color BYTE "blue",0**
 12. Declare an uninitialized array of 50 signed doublewords named dArray.**dArray SDWORD 50 DUP(?)**
 13. Declare a string variable containing the word “TEST” repeated 500 times.**test BYTE 500 DUP("TEST")**
 14. Declare an array of 20 unsigned bytes named bArray and initialize all elements to
 zero.**bArray BYTE 20 DUP(0)**
 15. Show the order of individual bytes in memory (lowest to highest) for the following double
word variable:
 val1 DWORD 87654321h**21,43,65,87**
