1. Improved Str_copy Procedure
The Str_copy procedure shown in this chapter does not limit the number of characters to be copied. Create a new version (named Str_copyN) that receives an additional input parameter indicating the maximum number of characters to be copied.
2. Str_concat Procedure
Write a procedure named Str_concat that concatenates a source string to the end of a target
string. Sufficient space must exist in the target string to accommodate the new characters. Pass
pointers to the source and target strings. Here is a sample call:
.data
targetStr BYTE "ABCDE",10 DUP(0)
sourceStr BYTE "FGH",0
.code
INVOKE Str_concat, ADDR targetStr, ADDR sourceStr
3. Str_remove Procedure
Write a procedure named Str_remove that removes n characters from a string. Pass a pointer to
the position in the string where the characters are to be removed. Pass an integer specifying the
number of characters to remove. The following code, for example, shows how to remove “xxxx”
from target:
.data
target BYTE "abcxxxxdefghijklmop",0
.code
INVOKE Str_remove, ADDR [target+3], 4
4. Str_find Procedure
Write a procedure named Str_find that searches for the first matching occurrence of a source string
inside a target string and returns the matching position. The input parameters should be a pointer to
the source string and a pointer to the target string. If a match is found, the procedure sets the Zero
flag and EAX points to the matching position in the target string. Otherwise, the Zero flag is clear
and EAX is undefined. The following code, for example, searches for “ABC” and returns with EAX
pointing to the “A” in the target string:
data
target BYTE "123ABC342432",0
source BYTE "ABC",0
pos DWORD ?
.code
INVOKE Str_find, ADDR source, ADDR target
jnz notFound
mov pos,eax ; store the position value
5. Str_nextWord Procedure
Write a procedure called Str_nextWord that scans a string for the first occurrence of a certain
delimiter character and replaces the delimiter with a null byte. There are two input parameters: a
pointer to the string and the delimiter character. After the call, if the delimiter was found, the Zero
flag is set and EAX contains the offset of the next character beyond the delimiter. Otherwise, the
Zero flag is clear and EAX is undefined. The following example code passes the address of target
and a comma as the delimiter:
.data
target BYTE "Johnson,Calvin",0
.code
INVOKE Str_nextWord, ADDR target, ','
jnz notFound
In Figure 9-5, after calling Str_nextWord, EAX points to the character following the position
where the comma was found (and replaced). 
Figure 9–5 Str_nextWord example.

6. Constructing a Frequency Table
Write a procedure named Get_frequencies that constructs a character frequency table. Input to
the procedure should be a pointer to a string and a pointer to an array of 256 doublewords initialized to all zeros. Each array position is indexed by its corresponding ASCII code. When the procedure returns, each entry in the array contains a count of how many times the corresponding
character occurred in the string. For example,
.data
target BYTE "AAEBDCFBBC",0
freqTable DWORD 256 DUP(0)
.code
INVOKE Get_frequencies, ADDR target, ADDR freqTable
Figure 9-6 shows a picture of the string and entries 41 (hexadecimal) through 4B in the frequency table. Position 41 contains the value 2 because the letter A (ASCII code 41h) occurred
twice in the string. Similar counts are shown for other characters. Frequency tables are useful in
data compression and other applications involving character processing. The Huffman encoding
algorithm, for example, stores the most frequently occurring characters in fewer bits than other
characters that occur less often.

7. Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes, invented by the Greek mathematician of the same name, provides a
quick way to find all prime numbers within a given range. The algorithm involves creating an array
of bytes in which positions are “marked” by inserting 1s in the following manner: Beginning with
position 2 (which is a prime number), insert a 1 in each array position that is a multiple of 2. Then
do the same thing for multiples of 3, the next prime number. Find the next prime number after 3,
which is 5, and mark all positions that are multiples of 5. Proceed in this manner until all multiples
of primes have been found. The remaining positions of the array that are unmarked indicate which
numbers are prime. For this program, create a 65,000-element array and display all primes
between 2 and 65,000. Declare the array in an uninitialized data segment (see Section 3.4.11) and
use STOSB to fill it with zeros.
8. Bubble Sort
Add a variable to the BubbleSort procedure in Section 9.5.1 that is set to 1 whenever a pair of
values is exchanged within the inner loop. Use this variable to exit the sort before its normal
completion if you discover that no exchanges took place during a complete pass through the
array. (This variable is commonly known as an exchange flag.)
9. Binary Search
Rewrite the binary search procedure shown in this chapter by using registers for mid, first, and
last. Add comments to clarify the registers’ usage.
10. Letter Matrix
Create a procedure that generates a four-by-four matrix of randomly chosen capital letters.
When choosing the letters, there must be a 50% probability that the chosen letter is a vowel.
Write a test program with a loop that calls your procedure five times and displays each matrix in
the console window. Following is sample output for the first three matrices:
D W A L
S I V W
U I O L
L A I I
K X S V
N U U O
O R Q O
A U U T
P O A Z
A E A U
G K A E
I A G D
11. Letter Matrix/Sets with Vowels
Use the letter matrix generated in the previous programming exercise as a starting point for this
program. Generate a single random four-by-four letter matrix in which each letter has a 50% probability of being a vowel. Traverse each matrix row, column, and diagonal, generating sets of letters.
Display only four-letter sets containing exactly two vowels. Suppose, for example, the following
matrix was generated:
P O A Z
A E A U
G K A E
I A G D
Then the four-letter sets displayed by the program would be POAZ, GKAE, IAGD, PAGI,
ZUED, PEAD, and ZAKI. The order of letters within each set is unimportant.
12. Calculating the Sum of an Array Row
Write a procedure named calc_row_sum that calculates the sum of a single row in a two-dimensional
array of bytes, words, or doublewords. The procedure should have the following stack parameters: array offset, row size, array type, row index. It must return the sum in EAX. Use explicit
stack parameters, not INVOKE or extended PROC. Write a program that tests your procedure
with arrays of byte, word, and doubleword. Prompt the user for the row index, and display the
sum of the selected row.
13. Trimming Leading Characters
Create a variant of the Str_trim procedure that lets the caller remove all instances of a leading
character from a string. For example, if you were to call it with a pointer to the string “###ABC”
and pass it the # character, the resulting string would be “ABC.”
14. Trimming a Set of Characters
Create a variant of the Str_trim procedure that lets the caller remove all instances of a set of
characters from the end of a string. For example, if you were to call it with a pointer to the string
“ABC#$&” and pass it a pointer to an array of filter characters containing “%#!;$&*”, the resulting string would be “ABC”.
